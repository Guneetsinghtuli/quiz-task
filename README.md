## Live Demo

[Quiz Task](https://quiz-task-orcin.vercel.app)

## Task
The task is to create a simple quiz application. The application uses opentdb api to fetch the questions and answers. 

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Challenges Faced

I didn't face any major challenges while building this application. The only part which i doubted was the implementation of the timer. I was looking for ways to implement the timer other than using setInterval or setTimeout which might create timing issues if we test it very thoroughly.
